# Client-Server

Incredibly basic project has been done to understand how the core Client-Server architecture works in C++.

In order to build the Client side and Server side you will need as well the following source files:
-stafx.h
-targetver.h

Then you have to create two different projects one for the Client side, the other for the Server side.
